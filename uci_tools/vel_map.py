        be 0 or 1 depending on which of the the pair the user wants to analyze.

        that leads to Olti's files, or they could supply their own path.
        Another option would be for the user to write their own `get_m12_path`
        method in uci_tools.vel_map and make a pull request so everyone
        has it.
    snap: str
        The snapshot number corresponding to `sim_path`. It should be in string

        that a particle must be at or below for the code to include it.
    zmax: float, default None

        The index that would appear vertically if the user printed the
        results. Note that this is the 0 axis (rows) of the resulting array.

    The grid orientation of the returned maps

        Simulation name to show in the plot.
    snap: str
        The snapshot number corresponding to the data. It should be in string
        format with three digits. The code uses this to
        display the correct look-back time in the plot.
    horiz_axis: int, default 0
        The index of the axis to show horizontally on the plot. The default is 
        the 0
        or x-axis.
    vert_axis: int, default 2
        The index of the axis to show vertically on the plot. The default is
